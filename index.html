    <p class="text-lg mb-4">This site is no longer maintained.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Local 417 Eats never really took off like we hoped. It was a fun project, born out of COVID to help the local community more easily access information about local restaurants that were still operating, in spite of tremendous challenges.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Since it's start, our family has moved away from the area and we support websites exclusively on Shopify at this point. The tech chosen for this website, at the time, was built on top of GatsbyJS. While a great option initially for the needs of the project, (static site generator that could easily manage large data sets using React and GraphQL to dynamically display data) over time it became a maintenance burden.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Additionally, the primary purpose of the site eroded when COVID closures were no longer a concern and the site was no longer needed. Information became outdated without getting local business buy-in. The project was just no longer helpful.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">In order to avoid promoting inaccurate information, we felt it was best to finally take the site down.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-center">Thanks for the memories!</h2>
